The license in the [original project](https://github.com/plexinc-plugins/Scanners.bundle) does not cover modification or redistribution.

I am not a lawyer. I intend this code to be a repackaging of other
publicly-available projects, not to be a significant work on its own. Therefore
I intend that the respective original licenses of the individual projects still
apply. I don't make any personal ownership or copyright claims. In any case
where ownership or copyright might fall to me, I release any such work to the
public domain.
